What is 413 error ?

A 413 error, also known as "Request Entity Too Large," occurs when the size of the data being 
sent in a request exceeds the maximum limit that the server is willing or able to process. 
This limit is typically set by the server configuration or by the API endpoint itself.


What's that in Spring Boot ?
In a Spring Boot application, a 413 error would typically be thrown by default if the size 
of the HTTP request exceeds the maximum limit configured in the server or 
in the Spring Boot application itself.

Default Values of each embedded servers.

1. Tomcat: The default maximum size for HTTP POST request body in Tomcat is 2MB.
2. Jetty: The default maximum size for HTTP POST request body in Jetty is 200KB.
3. Undertow: The default maximum size for HTTP POST request body in Undertow is unlimited.

Ways to solve: 

1. Here are the properties to adjust the maximum request size for each servlet container:
    a) For Tomcat: server.tomcat.max-http-form-post-size
    b) For Jetty: server.jetty.max-http-post-size
    c) For Undertow: server.undertow.max-http-post-size
Example:
server.tomcat.max-http-form-post-size=5MB
Here,
server.tomcat.max-swallow-size=XMB //maximum size of the request body/payload
server.tomcat.max-http-post-size=XMB //maximum size of entire POST request

2. Optimize Data Size: Review the data being sent with the request and see if it can be optimized. 
For example, compressing data before sending it over the network can reduce its size.
3. Chunked Transfer Encoding.
4. Streaming: Instead of loading the entire request body into memory, stream the data directly to disk or process it incrementally.
